playPrompt == true and playPrompt == false have same cases.

If the field is not specified in the request then it is based
on the CallerId parameter specified in RingCentral application (Main phone Number/Current Location
Number/Blocked).

If CallerID has a "+" in the front, it will give ERROR 403.


Current Problem: Cannot put extension in CallerID
